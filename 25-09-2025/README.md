## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps
1. Initialized the project with **`npm init`**.  
2. Installed **Express.js** using `npm install express`.  
3. Created a **basic Express server** running on port 3000.  
4. Defined an **in-memory array of book objects** with `{id, title, author}`.  
5. Implemented REST API endpoints.
6. Used **middleware `express.json()`** to handle JSON request bodies.  
7. Tested all endpoints with **Postman** to verify CRUD functionality.

- Using **Express.js routing** for endpoints  
- Handling **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE  
- **JSON parsing and response handling**  
- CRUD operations with **in-memory data storage**  
- Using **Postman** for API testing

## üîó API Endpoints
- `GET /books` ‚Üí Get all books  
- `POST /books` ‚Üí Add a new book (requires JSON body)  
- `PUT /books/:id` ‚Üí Update book details by ID  
- `DELETE /books/:id` ‚Üí Delete a book by ID
