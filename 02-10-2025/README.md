## 🎯 Objective
Use **JavaScript Fetch API** to retrieve user data from the public API:  
👉 `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`  
and dynamically display **name, email, and address** on the webpage.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **VS Code** – Development environment  
- **Chrome Browser** – Testing and debugging  
- **Fetch API** – For making HTTP requests  
- **JSON** – Parsing API response  

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. Created an **HTML container** to display user data.  
2. Used **JavaScript Fetch API** to request data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.  
3. Parsed the **JSON response**.  
4. Looped through the user list and displayed:  
   - Name  
   - Email  
   - Address (street, city, zipcode)  
5. Added **error handling** with `.catch()` for failed requests.  
6. Tested **network error handling** by disabling internet.  
7. Styled the user cards with **CSS** for readability.  
8. Added a **Reload button** to refetch data without refreshing the page.

## 📚 Key Concepts Learned
- Using the **Fetch API** to make GET requests  
- Understanding **Promises** and `.then()` chaining  
- Handling **JSON parsing** in JavaScript  
- **Error handling** with `.catch()`  
- Displaying data dynamically with **DOM manipulation**  
- Building resilient apps with **network error testing**  

---

## ✅ Outcome
Successfully built a **webpage** that fetches and displays user data from a **public API**.  
The app demonstrates **asynchronous JavaScript**, **JSON parsing**, and **error handling**.
